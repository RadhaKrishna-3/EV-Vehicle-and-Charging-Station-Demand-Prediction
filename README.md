Electric vehicles (EVs) are the future — eco-friendly, efficient, and rapidly adopted worldwide. But to support their rise, charging infrastructure needs to be planned ahead of time.

In this AICTE-Edunet project, I built a complete machine learning pipeline to analyze historical EV registration data from Washington State (USA) and predict future EV adoption rates — a stepping stone to planning charging demand.

This project helped me learn:

Data cleaning from real government data

Time series forecasting and regression

Building and deploying ML models

📊 Problem Statement
“How can we use historical vehicle registration data to forecast the number and percentage of EVs in the future?”

By predicting EV trends, we can:

Estimate charging station requirements

Guide policy and urban planning

Understand regional adoption patterns
 
 Thanks for shell  and edunet for giving this oppurtunity to upskill in carrer though this internship!!
